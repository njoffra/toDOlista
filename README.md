# toDOlista
While organizing my computer projects, I required a straightforward to-do list for knowing what needed to be done whenever my PC booted up. 
I then adapted a basic Python to-do list on my computer, built it with PyInstaller, and configured it to launch automatically on startup. 
This setup ensures I receive reminders of my tasks, even if the presence of the to-do list slips from my mind :)
